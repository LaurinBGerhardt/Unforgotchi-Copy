# Unforgotchi-Copy
### PEMA-Seminar SS21 Gruppe1

Who doesn't already know the feeling of standing right in front of the store or the subway, just to realize that one forgot to bring a mask? 
With Unforgotchi, this problem is forever solved! 

First, the user can create multiple lists of commonly forgotten items in certain circumstances. Afterwards, the user can create locations based on WiFi IDs. 
When creating or editing a location, a list is chosen. As soon as the WiFi connections breaks, the user receives a push notification containing all the items of the specified list - unless the subway is right next to the door, unforgotchi will save the user from loosing much valuable time!

Unforgotchi was a group assignment at our university. The other collaborators are [Paul Felkner](https://github.com/pfelkner) and [Janka Deldok](https://github.com/JankaDeldok/).
The reason I chose to fork the [original project](https://github.com/JankaDeldok/Unforgotchi) is due to me having contributed using a "private" GitHub profile, which is no longer active. 
During the project, my main focus was the [locations](https://github.com/LaurinBGerhardt/Unforgotchi-Copy/tree/main_v2/app/src/main/java/com/jlp/unforgotchi/locations) package.
